### Proposed System

The development of this system contains the following activities, which try to automate the entire process keeping in th view of database integration approach.

• This system is maintain user's personal information, address, and contact details.

• Users friendliness is provided in the application with various controls provided by the system rich user interface.

  Dou to the real time and error free features, hotel management have access to an accurate daily reports that can be either showed or printed.

• Prevent double booking.
  In a manual operations, double booking is a common scenario but this project can avoid this occurrence .

### Scope

• In future the software could be further enhanced by providing our customers with the facility of booking more than one rooms at the same time and keeping his/her customer_id the same.

• Apart from that in future our software can also be used for hotels that provide both lodging and food facilities, in such case
  our software would also keep a record of food supplements and recruited staffs in our database.
